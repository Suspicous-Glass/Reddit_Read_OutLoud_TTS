Reads reddit comments out loud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Reads comments from any post on reddit out loud.

Depending on when you are running the code it may or may not work, depending on if the default post is still there.

I made this when I was 14 as a special post in the subreddit r/askreddit. I wanted to make a post, and make the bot read all the comments out loud on a livestream. The plan was the livestream to be a blank wall, but unfortunatly I got banned for breaking the "no bots" rule.
